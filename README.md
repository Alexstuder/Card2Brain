## Create a Docker Container, Run and Publish to DockerHub

Create first a jar with the build instruction. Then create a container. Replace **dockerHubID** with your **dockerhub id
**.

<br/>



-> The application will be available at http://localhost:9001.



<br/>

```
$  mvn clean package
$  docker build -t dockerHubID/card2Brain
$  docker run -p 9001/9001 --rm -it  dockerHubID/card2Brain
```

<br/>

Ctrl c will stop and delete the container.

<br/>



```
$  docker login
$  docker login --username dockerHubID --password 
$  docker push dockerHubID/card2Brain
```
<br/>

login to deployment platform with a container infrastructure:

<br/>



```
$  docker pull dockerHubID/card2Brain
```

##  docker-compose

Start the files with:

<br/>

Start with log output in the console

```
$  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
